## XLogin ##

A WordPress plugin to allow user to login with external services
like Facebook, Google, and Yahoo.

This plugin allows multiple users to share a WordPress account
without knowing its password. A database table maps external
aliases to WordPress accounts; the aliases are established with
the help of external services. For example, if a user signs in
with Google, the plugin retrieves their email address from Google
to look up the corresponding WordPress account. The external
aliases are stored as hash values in the database to minimize
exposure of user information in case of security breach.

The plugin is published in the plugin directory of WordPress.org.
See the [rendered readme.txt](https://wordpress.org/plugins/xlogin/)
for a more detailed description of its features.
